#SONARQUBE 
##SonarQube overview 
Continuous Code Inspection
SonarQube Architecture can be classified in four components
1. Sonar Scanner
2. Source Code
3. Sonar Analyzer
4. SonarQube Database
....................................................................................................................................
Sonar covers the 7 sections of code quality
1. Architecture and Design
2. Unit tests
3. Duplicated code
4. Potential bugs
5. Complex code
6. Coding standards
7. Comments
....................................................................................................................................
##Benifits
- Open source
- Supports for various languages 
- Reports for duplicate code, unit testing, code coverage, code complexity historical
- Integrate SonarQube with build tools like ant, gradle
- Eclipse plugin like Sonarlint
- Supports external plugins like plugin for ldap

SonarQube vs SonarLint 
1. SonarQube has a server associated with it where SonarLint works more like a plugin.
2. SonarQube is a central server that processes full analyses which is triggered by the 
various SonarQube Scanners(sonarqube runner) where SonarLint lives only in the IDE 
3. SonarQube purpose is to give a 360Â° vision of the quality of your code base 
where SonarLint give instantaneous feedback as you type your code
4. SonarQube analyzes all the source lines of your project on a regular basis 
but SonarLint concentrates on what code you are adding or updating
5. SonarQube is a server where you can host your projects and execute analysis
SonarLint is an agent that allow us to connect with this SonarQube and execute the analysis remotely.

1. Architecture and Integration of SonarQube explains what happens with the installation of Sonar code scanner.
2. The database can be any relational \ database like Oracle, MySQL
-Used to store the analysis results that can be displayed using the UI of the tool.
3. Quality Profiles:define sets of Rules that when violated should raise issues on your codebase(defined for individual languages)
4. Quality Gates can be defined as a set of threshold measures set on your project 
-Quality gate compliance is calculated as part of the analysis.
